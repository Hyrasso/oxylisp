# TODOs

- [ ] : Tail recurseion and everything in there: http://norvig.com/lispy2.html
- [x] a repl
    - better error handling to not be kicked out all the time
- [ ] executing from files, maybe some load macro
- [ ] refactor: how does interpreter, env and eval relates to each other code wise  
    improve exp generation from string, clumsy (exp_from_token seems a bit weird and not in the right place)
- [ ] : explore the use of Rc::clone each time eval needs to be passed as ref is called, might not be necessary

## interpreter.rs
- [x] define what is environment (hashmap string -> Exp)
- [x] how to define procedure/user defined procedure (lambda) in the environmnet, they are 'tokens' : build an env when run with params updated with arguments value 
- [x] Maybe put seperation between tokens and ast types (symbol, lambda, values)
- [x] what does eval do : takes Exp returns Exp
- [x] what does sould eval do : takes Exp returns Result< Exp>
    - [ ] : better errors, giving actual info
- implement Fundamental forms: ✓ define, ✓ lambda, ✓ quote, ✓ if, define-syntax, let-syntax, letrec-syntax, syntax-rules, ✓ set!
- implement some std funct (maths, comp is a good start), see for things with side effects (print, i/o)  
    std funct needs either a new exp type or maybe they could be implemented alongside keywords like if, define, ... 
    - maths (+-/*)
    - type comp number? procedure? symbol?
    - comp (><=)
    - bool (not and or)
    - array/vector/linkedlist manipulation (can use default exp::list, but can be mixed type)  
        lambda calculus way to implement pair : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons (from then we can build linked list and binary trees and probably more)
    - stdin/stdout (print, fopen, write, read) (needs some string/char and array type)

## integration tests suite for basic lisp programs
- tests  
    https://github.com/ashinn/chibi-scheme/tree/master/tests  
    http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile.git/tree/test-suite/tests
- learn some lisp
- separate test files/ or split interpreter and env, interpreter is getting very confusing

## bugs
- strange recursion causing stack overflow: probably because building a list like
    ((... (1 2) adding 0) for 0) each 0) call 0)
    ```
    (define foo (lambda x (foo x 0)))
    (foo 1 2)
    ```
    Having the list on the heap would be a solution, this code is also data thing is weird
